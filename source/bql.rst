The BQL Language
################

This part describes the use of the BQL language in SensorBee.
We start with describing the general syntax of BQL, then explain how to create the structures for data in-/output and stateful operations.
After that, the general processing model and the remaining BQL query types are explained.
Finally, we list operators and functions that can be used in BQL expressions.
